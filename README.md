# Website with covid-19 & vaccination data for Cyprus
The website: https://geomich.github.io/covid_cyprus/covid_cy_report.html

Here I am using data from Cyprus' Ministry of Health to create some interactive plots that allow quick & comprehensive overview of the status of the pandemic in Cyprus.

The graphs are updated every day based on the latest announcements of the ministry.
